# Multi-Vendor E-Commerce Platform

### Product & Technical Specification

A multi-vendor marketplace where independent sellers list products, customers buy them, drivers deliver them, and an administrator oversees the entire operation from a single control panel.

**Delivery scope:** 2 mobile applications · 2 web platforms · 1 shared backend

### Why this architecture

| Decision                     | Reasoning                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Separate Customer app        | Keeps the shopping experience fast and lightweight — no seller tooling weighing it down    |
| Driver inside the Vendor app | Delivery staff get a simple, focused mode instead of a fifth product to build and maintain |
| Vendor on both app and web   | Sellers manage on the go, but do bulk work comfortably on a larger screen                  |
| Admin on web only            | The admin dashboard carries the heaviest workflows and needs the screen real estate        |

## 2. Access Levels

```mermaid
graph LR
    L1["Level 1<br/>Customer"] --> L2["Level 2<br/>Vendor"] --> L3["Level 3<br/>Admin"]
    L4["Level 4<br/>Driver"] -.-> L2

    style L1 fill:#e8f4f8,stroke:#5a9
    style L2 fill:#fff4e0,stroke:#e90
    style L3 fill:#fde8e8,stroke:#c55
    style L4 fill:#f0f0f0,stroke:#999
```

Every request is authenticated with JWT and authorised against the user's role. No endpoint is reachable outside its permitted level.

| #   | Capability                                                                                     |

| 16  | Centralised dashboard covering approvals, catalogue, users, transactions, stock and commission |

### 3.4 Driver — Level 4 _(Minimal by design)_

**Platform:** Driver mode inside the Vendor mobile app

| #   | Capability                                                  |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Log in with driver credentials                              |
| 2   | View orders assigned for delivery                           |
| 3   | View customer name, address and contact for assigned orders |
| 4   | Update delivery status                                      |
| 5   | Mark Cash on Delivery payment as collected                  |

> Deliberately limited to the five actions required for the delivery loop to function. No analytics, no earnings module, no routing — those add cost without adding capability at launch.

### 3.5 Shared System Features

| #   | Capability                                      |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | JWT authentication and tokenisation             |
| 2   | Role-based authorisation across all four levels |
| 3   | Hashed passwords, no plain-text storage         |
| 4   | Encrypted API communication                     |
| 5   | Secure session handling                         |
| 6   | Referral system                                 |
| 7   | Promotional coupon system                       |
| 8   | Google Analytics integration                    |
| 9   | Loyalty / credit-coin system                    |

## 4. Vendor Onboarding & Product Approval

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Vendor registers"] --> B{"Admin reviews profile"}
    B -->|Rejected| C["Registration declined"]
    B -->|Approved| D["Vendor can upload products"]
    D --> E{"Verified Vendor?"}
    E -->|No| F{"Admin reviews product"}
    F -->|Rejected| G["Returned to vendor"]
    F -->|Approved| H["Product goes live"]
    E -->|Yes| H
    G --> D
```

The Verified Vendor tier removes the approval bottleneck for proven sellers while keeping new sellers gated — quality control that scales.

---

## 5. Order Lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Placed
    Placed --> Confirmed
    Confirmed --> Processing
    Processing --> Shipped
    Shipped --> OutForDelivery: Assigned to Driver
    OutForDelivery --> Delivered
    Delivered --> Completed
    Completed --> [*]
```

Status is updated by the Vendor, the Driver, or the Admin depending on the stage. Orders containing items from multiple vendors are split into separate shipments, each tracked independently.

---

## 6. Payments

Payments are handled as a phased rollout rather than a single launch feature.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph P1["Phase 1 — Launch"]
        A1["Customer orders"] --> B1["Cash on Delivery"]
        B1 --> C1["Driver collects"]
        C1 --> D1["Admin confirms<br/>and reconciles commission"]
    end

    subgraph P2["Phase 2 — Post-Launch"]
        A2["Customer pays online"] --> B2["SSLCommerz"]
        B2 --> C2["Admin account"]
        C2 --> D2["Commission deducted<br/>automatically"]
        D2 --> E2["Balance to Vendor"]
    end
```

**Phase 1 — Cash on Delivery only.** Every order launches as COD to build customer trust before any online payment is introduced. Vendor and Driver update delivery status; Admin confirms collection and reconciles commission manually.

**Phase 2 — SSLCommerz added.** One gateway, no others planned. Customer pays through the platform, funds reach the Admin account, commission is deducted automatically and the balance is allocated to the vendor. COD remains available alongside it.

---

## 7. Cancellation, Return & Refund

This spans all four roles, so it is specified separately. Two options are on the table.

**Option A — Full flow with Dispute Centre**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Customer submits request"] --> B{"Vendor reviews"}
    B -->|Approved| E["Resolution processed"]
    B -->|Rejected| C{"Customer disputes?"}
    C -->|No| D["Case closed"]
    C -->|Yes| F["Admin Dispute Centre"]
    F --> G["Final decision:<br/>refund, replacement or rejection"]
    G --> E
```

**Option B — Simple manual handling** _(recommended for launch)_

- Customer contacts Admin or Vendor through live chat — no dedicated request form or escalation workflow
- Admin reviews each case manually and decides the outcome
- Refunds are recorded and processed manually
- Significantly cheaper to build, and upgradeable to Option A once order volume justifies it

---

## 8. Enhancement Roadmap

Beyond the core specification, the following are recommended additions — sequenced so the marketplace launches lean and grows on real usage data.

**Customer**
Product ratings and reviews · real-time order tracking with delivery timeline · order history and one-click reorder · coupon and loyalty-point redemption at checkout · product Q&A · order notifications · guest checkout · cart saved across devices · social login

**Vendor**
Branded storefront page · sales analytics dashboard · public replies to reviews · downloadable payout and commission statements · vendor rating based on delivery time, quality and responsiveness

**Admin**
Site-wide analytics — GMV, active users, conversion rate, top categories · review and Q&A moderation · admin action audit log · CMS for static pages · scheduled product publishing · product status history

**AI-Powered**
Typeahead search suggestions · recommendation engine for personalised product discovery · automated FAQ chatbot that escalates to live chat when needed

**Platform-Wide**
Order lifecycle tracking · split shipments for multi-vendor orders · push and email notifications · in-app notification centre · flash sales with countdown timers · first-order discount · email newsletters · two-factor authentication for Admin and Vendor · rate limiting and brute-force protection · input sanitisation against SQL injection and XSS · PDF invoice generation · exportable accounting reports · responsive and accessible UI

| Stage                | Duration | Deliverable                                                 |
| -------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Discovery & planning | 2 weeks  | Finalised requirements, data model, API contract            |
| UI/UX design         | 4 weeks  | Wireframes and high-fidelity screens for all four platforms |
| Backend core         | 5 weeks  | Auth, roles, catalogue, cart, order APIs                    |
| Admin panel          | 5 weeks  | Full control panel with approval workflows                  |
| Vendor web panel     | 4 weeks  | Product and order management on web                         |
| Customer app         | 6 weeks  | Browse, search, cart, checkout, profile                     |
| Vendor app           | 4 weeks  | Mobile product and order management                         |
| Driver mode          | 2 weeks  | Assigned deliveries and status updates                      |
| Order & COD flows    | 2 weeks  | End-to-end order and payment reconciliation                 |
| QA & UAT             | 3 weeks  | Testing, bug fixes, client sign-off                         |
| Deployment           | 1 week   | Production launch, store submissions                        |

**Total: approximately 24 weeks (6 months) to production launch.**

Stages overlap where dependencies allow, which is what keeps a four-platform build inside six months rather than stretching past nine.

### Post-launch phases

| Phase   | Focus                                                                                         | Estimated  |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Phase 2 | SSLCommerz integration, reviews and ratings, notifications, order tracking, coupons, wishlist | 6–8 weeks  |
| Phase 3 | Loyalty points, referral programme, vendor analytics, flash sales                             | 6–8 weeks  |
| Phase 4 | AI recommendations, advanced analytics, chatbot, dispute centre                               | 8–10 weeks |
